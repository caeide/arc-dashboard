# arc-dashboard
A dash app collection analysis.
This is my first attempt at python (and dash). 

A major hindrance to collection maintenance of the Automatic Retreival Collection (ARC) is that some of the information is in Dematic (storage system) and some of it is in Alma (library catalog). The collection is large enough that when you combine them it maxes out Excel. 
During an on-going collection audit, I started finding mold. This analysis is attempting to find any correlation or explanation (year, material, location, etc) to what items become moldy. I wanted something that provided useful visualizations, and also something that I could easily update- in this case, adding more rows to the updating load files. I was also happy to discover I could relatively easily create location based visuals, both 2-D and 3-D.

Note both 'combo' and 'all inventory' were too large to upload. I have chosen to upload a partial inventory and leave off combo, which was created using the other available files.
